We count our days not just in hours.
But in the moments, connections made,
Where human hearts are gently laid.

The lanterns float on evening air,
While distant music fills the square.
In every culture, every place,
We find reflections of our grace.

So let us journey, let us roam,
Through foreign lands to find our home.
For in each city, each new sight,
We discover our own inner light.`,
